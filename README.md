## About This Repo

This site was built by [David Dickinson](https://david-dickinson.com) to document a simple website build using Laravel 11 (and because he loves the L322 model Range Rover).

The code used throughout this demo supports a blog post due out on the 11th November 2024. You can read the full article at:

## Why the L322 Range Rover?

The L322 Range Rover holds a special place in the hearts of many Land Rover enthusiasts. It represents a perfect balance between the rugged capabilities of its predecessors and the luxurious features that would come to define later models. This website serves as a tribute to this iconic vehicle, showcasing its history, features, and enduring appeal.
